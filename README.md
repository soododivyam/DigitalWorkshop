# DigitalWorkshop
Repository made to upload codes made as part of workshop conducted by Dr. GVV Sharma in IISERB

For the course, we are following this book: https://github.com/gadepall/digital-design/blob/main/main.pdf

#Workshop schedule
The workshop had 2 parts:
<li> From 06 October to 10 October 2025: For this workshop, I have labelled the folders containing the code of that day with their date itself.</li>
<li>From 07 November 2025 to 11 November 2025: This workshop is yet to happen, hoping for a productive time. For this workshop, I am planning to make the name the folder as the task we are doing.</li>
